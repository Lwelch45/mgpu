MGPU

The MGPU library strives to simplify the implementation of high performance applications and algorithms on multi-GPU systems. Its main goal is both to abstract platform dependent functions and vendor specific APIs, as well as simplifying communication between different compute elements. The library is currently an alpha release containing only limited yet already useful functionality.
